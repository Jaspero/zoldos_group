# Zoldos Group

## About the Zoldos Group


## Technologies we used

The app fits in the [JAM](https://jamstack.org/) stack. The SSG we used is [Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully) on top of Angular.
The CMS is a very simple implementation of the [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). We also use [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) for CI/CD.

Both the website and the CMS are hocdsted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Why is this open source 

Jaspero benefits greatly from the open source community. This app in its entirety is made possible because of open source software. Because of this we try to open source as many of our projects as we can. 

We don't have the required manpower and experties to build frameworks and tools the community could directly use in building awesome software, so by open sourcing our projects we hope people can find inspiration or code snippets to speed up development.

## Building scully

To build the scully app run `npm run build:app` this in turn runs a few commands:

- `npm --prefix app run build` - builds the angular app
- `copy:collections` - copies all the collections from the public folder in to the angular dist folder in order to make them available to the scully build.
- `npm --prefix app run build:scully` - runs the scully build
- `cleanup` - removes any old scully build from the public folder
- `copy:app` - moves the entire build back to the public folder

## Running Scully locally

- Run `npm run build`
- Copy collections from `public/collections` in to `dist/collections`
- Run `npm run scully`

## Adding Blocks

1. Define the block in `public/admin/config.yml`
2. Add the name of the block in to `app/components/blocks/blocks.components.ts`. The name needs to equal the name field
defined for the block in `config.yml`
3. Create the component in the `app/shared/modules/blocks/` folder. The naming convention we use is `[block-name]-block`.
The only required property each block needs to have is `data`.
4. In the `app/shared/modules/blocks/block-renderer/block-renderer.component.ts` extend the `BLOCKS_MAP` object
with your newly added block. The name needs to be the key and the component the value. This tells the renderer
component which block to use when it encounters a specific name. 

## OAuth

### Create an OAuth app

You will need an OAuth app to authenticate with. For GitHub, the instructions can be found in the [GitHub Developer Documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

### Configure the Firebase environment

Tell Firebase which project to use:

```
firebase use your-project-id
```

Set the `oauth.client_id` and `oauth.client_secret` Firebase environment variables using the values from the GitHub OAuth app:

```
firebase functions:config:set oauth.client_id=yourclientid oauth.client_secret=yourclientsecret
```
