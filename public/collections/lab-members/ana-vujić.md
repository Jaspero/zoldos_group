Ana graduated Molecular Biology at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Science in November 2019. Two months later, she joined the Zoldoš Lab as a research associate on the project CEKOM „Molecular diagnostics“. She also did her master's thesis work in this group, where she designed pyrosequencing assays for analyzing DNA methylation in *HNF1A* gene targeted with TET1-dCas9 and VPR-dCas9 fusions. Currently, her work is focused on studying how targeted editing of DNA methylation using CRISPR/dCas9-based tools affects the changes in histone modifications.
