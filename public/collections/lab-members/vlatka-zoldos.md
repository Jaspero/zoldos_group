Vlatka Zoldoš, PhD, is a full professor at the University of Zagreb Faculty of Science, and a principle investigator running a Laboratory for epigenetics at the Department of molecular biology. She completed her PhD at the University of Paris Sud XI in France in 2000 as a scholar of French government. She moved back to Croatia where she was elected as an assistant professor at the University of Zagreb Faculty of science in 2003. Her main research interest is epigenetics of protein glycosylation associated with human diseases. Her pioneering efforts in this field resulted in several prominent papers including the first demonstration of the epigenetic regulation of plasma protein and IgG glycosylation. She and her team were the first who have developed CRISPR/dCas9-based molecular tools for targeted DNA methylation/demethylation. She is involved in several large projects funded by EU foundations, and her group is a part of the Centre of Scientific Excellence in Personalized Healthcare and Centre of Competence in Molecular Diagnostics in Croatia. She is teaching Genetics, Epigenetics and Molecular Cytogenetics for students of undergraduate and graduate studies of Master’s degree in Molecular Biology at the Faculty of Science and doctorate study of Biology at the University of Zagreb.
