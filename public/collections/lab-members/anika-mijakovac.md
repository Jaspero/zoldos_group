Anika graduated with a Master's degree in Molecular Biology at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb in 2019. She was working on her master's thesis „A vector system for transposase-mediated stable genomic integration of an expression cassete“ under the mentorship of Prof. Vlatka Zoldoš with an aim to develop stable cell lines for expression of CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenome modulators. She is currently working as a phD student in Zoldoš Lab where she studies regulation of genes of interest for IgG glycosylation using HEK293FreeStyle transient system for IgG production and CRISPR/dCas9 technology within the project of the Center of exellence in Personalized Healthcare. She is also involved in teaching (practical courses in Genetics and Molecular genetics).
