Karlo graduated at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, in 2019 with a Master's degree in Molecular Biology with *magna cum laude* honors. He was working on his master's thesis project in Plant Tissue Culture Laboratory under the mentorship of Assoc. prof. Dunja Leljak-Levanić where he focused on BPM1 protein as a novel regulator of RNA directed DNA methylation in plant develompent and its importance in *de novo* methylation of plant genome, using bacteria, yeast and plant models. Karlo just joined Zoldos Lab and is interested in genomic engineering and regulation of genes involved in imunoglobulin G glycosylation. He is using CRISPR/dCas9 technology and HEK293FreeStyle transient system for IgG production with a focus on glycoengineering of IgG antibody within the CRISPR/dCas9 - CasMouse project.
