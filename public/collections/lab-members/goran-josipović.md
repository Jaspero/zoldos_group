Goran graduated with a Master’s degree in Molecular Biology at Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb in 2016 . He was working on his master’s thesis “Targeted DNA methylation of the *MGAT3* gene promoter using a CRISPR‐Cas9 tool”under the mentorship of Prof. Vlatka Zoldoš. From 2017 he works in Zoldos Lab as a PhD student . For the last four years, his main focus was a development of CRISPR/dCas9-based modular tools for targeted epigenome editing and direct gene regulation. Currently, Goran is using these molecular tools in targeting eQTL regions, where SNP changes are associated with inflammatory phenotype in chronic inflammatory diseases (CID), within the Horizon 2020 project SYSCID. He won Young Investigator Award (2017) at 10th ISABS Conference.He is also involved in teaching (practical courses in Genetics).
